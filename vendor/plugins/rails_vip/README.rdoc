= VotingInfoProj

This plugin will let you use the Voting Information Project's data in your own election information application.  It provides rake tasks for importing source files and models for using the data. Simple default controllers are included, but can be superceded by any you create in apps/controllers.  If you're interested in sample views, check out the {demo app}[http://github.com/neworganizing/rails_vip_demo].
